# Compiling to scratch

One fateful day, an idea came to me and stuck in my brain like a seed: evergrowing. Until one day where I said "fuck it, I'm going to make a compiler for scratch" and started researching.

Dragging and dropping is cool and all, but do you know what is faster? Typing. Therefore I set out to recreate the scratch experience with text: my own little programming language.

Turns out the scratch's sb3 file format is just a renamed zip file which contains images and a project.json file that contains all of the information for a project. Therefore, to make scratch programming language, you just need to do the steps in reverse!

Documentation on the language that I'm creating will come in the future, but until then, good luck I guess.
